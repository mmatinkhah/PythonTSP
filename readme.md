"Optimal Route Discovery: Unraveling the Puzzle of the Traveling Salesman"
=======================================




The provided code solves the Traveling Salesman Problem (TSP) using integer linear programming (ILP) and the PuLP library. The TSP is a classic optimization problem in which a salesman needs to visit a set of cities and return to the starting city while minimizing the total distance traveled.

Let's walk through the code step by step:

1. The code defines the distance matrix, which represents the distances between each pair of cities. Each row and column in the matrix corresponds to a city, and the value at position (i, j) represents the distance between city i and city j.

2. The number of cities is determined by the length of the distance matrix.

3. The code creates a binary variable, x[(i, j)], for each possible edge between two cities (excluding self-loops). This variable indicates whether the edge is selected in the optimal route.

4. The TSP model is created using LpProblem from PuLP. The goal is to minimize the total distance traveled.

5. The objective function is set by summing the distances of the selected edges multiplied by their corresponding binary variables.

6. Constraints are added to ensure that each city is visited exactly once. Two sets of constraints are added, one for the outgoing edges from each city and one for the incoming edges to each city.

7. Subtour elimination constraints are added to prevent the formation of subtours, which are partial cycles that do not include all cities. These constraints use additional variables u[i] to maintain a consistent order of visited cities. The constraints ensure that if an edge (i, j) is selected, the difference between the values of u[i] and u[j] is less than or equal to N-1, where N is the number of cities.

8. The TSP problem is solved using tsp_model.solve(). The solver (CBC) is invoked internally to find an optimal solution.

9. After solving the problem, the code extracts the solution by iteratively following the selected edges starting from the initial city (0) until it returns to the initial city. The optimal route is stored in the list optimal_route.

10. The optimal distance is obtained by accessing the value of the objective function (total distance) using value(tsp_model.objective).

11. Finally, the optimal route and its distance are printed.

In this specific execution, the code found the optimal route [0, 9, 8, 6, 1, 5, 3, 2, 7, 4, 0] with an optimal distance of 205.0. This means that the salesman starts from city 0, visits cities 9, 8, 6, 1, 5, 3, 2, 7, and 4 in the given order, and then returns to city 0, minimizing the total distance traveled.
